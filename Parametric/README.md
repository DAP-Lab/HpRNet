Parametric
----

1. *Carnatic_HpS* : Set of functions implementing our proposed parametric model
2. *carnatic_processing* : Obtaining the parametric representation of audio, and saving it as a pickle dump
3. *carnatic_resynth* : Testing the parametric representation by inverting it and saving the reconstructed audio
