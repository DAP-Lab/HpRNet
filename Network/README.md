1. *carnatic_synth_HpR* : Independent training of Harmonic and Residual networks
2. *network_concat* : Modeling potential interdependencies in harmonic and residual by concatanatively modeling them with a single network
3. *network_hprnet* : Modeling potential interdependencies in harmonic and residual by modeling sum and difference of harmonic and residual components with two different networks
